# Mirele A2

### History

Mirele development began in May 2020. From May 2020 to June 2020, Mirele was open. It was possible to install new blocks, expand it with additional functions, etc. At the end of June, Mirele was rewritten and changed its architecture, as well as changed its policy - now it is a single product aimed exclusively at its style, its blocks, its internal extensions.
On August 26, 2020 there was a refusal of further support of own architectures. Because of this, the architecture of MIrele was replaced by A2
