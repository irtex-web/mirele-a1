# Tips:
# 1. If a file 'index.html' is created in a public folder,
#    it will be shown when a user tries to get into a directory with all public files.
#    Access to this file via .ignore cannot be denied
#    access to this file will be granted bypassing .ignore

# Specify the files that should not be indexed

.ignore
index.html
